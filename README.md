This repository contains many popular software licenses. This is intended for use with the [license-add](https://github.com/nokaa/license-add) utility, but you can use it for whatever you want! Note that many of these licenses contain boilerplate that should be replaced; i.e. you should enter your copyright information.

If you think a license should be added, open an issue or submit a pull request. It is likely that I have forgotten many popular licenses.
